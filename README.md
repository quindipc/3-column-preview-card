## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap

### What I learned
I learned a little bit about media query. It's not perfect, but I think I'm slowly understanding and getting better. I designed this in the mobile design first and then added @media to change the views. 

```css
/* Change in Desktop view */
@media screen and (min-width: 992px) {

    .col {
        float: left;
        width: 33.33%;
    }

```


### Continued development
I will continue to learn more about the different screen sizes for media query and get better and testing my code and experimenting with different things.
